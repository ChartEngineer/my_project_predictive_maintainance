# Predictive Maintenance System for Industrial Equipment

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning system for predicting equipment failures in industrial settings. The system processes sensor data, trains predictive models, and provides maintenance recommendations.

## Features
- Data ingestion and preprocessing for industrial sensor data
- Feature engineering for time-series sensor data
- Machine learning models for failure prediction
- Real-time prediction API
- Visualization and reporting dashboard

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.11
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
- Flask for API deployment
